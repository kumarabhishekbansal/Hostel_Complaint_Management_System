# Introduction

Many educational institutions and organizations manage hostel facilities for students or employees. However, addressing complaints and issues within these hostel environments can often be inefficient and time-consuming due to manual processes or lack of a centralized system. This project aims to streamline the complaint handling process, enhance communication between stakeholders, and improve overall hostel management efficiency.

# Features

Intuitive User Interface: Utilizing React for dynamic, user-centric design, the system ensures a seamless experience for users, allowing for easy complaint submission and tracking.
Real-Time Tracking: Implementing WebSocket protocols provides instant updates and transparency throughout the complaint resolution process, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
Efficient Data Management: MongoDB's scalable, NoSQL database management allows for efficient data processing, storage, and retrieval, empowering hostel staff with actionable insights.
Responsive Design: Engineered with responsive web design principles, the system ensures cross-platform compatibility and optimal performance on various devices.
Backend Architecture: Node.js and Express.js power the server-side development, ensuring a scalable, high-performance backend capable of handling multiple concurrent requests.
API Integration: RESTful APIs facilitate seamless communication between the client and server, ensuring efficient data exchange and enhancing system modularity.
Security and Authentication: Robust authentication mechanisms and data encryption techniques are implemented to ensure the security and privacy of user data.
